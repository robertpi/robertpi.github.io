I woke up early a couple of days ago and to pass the time till the rest of the house woke up, I decided to do a little hobby programming. I wanted to do a little animation around a star fractal. I didn't find the [Koch snowflake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake) astatically pleasing, so I thought I'd make my own based on a [tree fractal algorithm](http://davis.wpi.edu/~matt/courses/fractals/trees.html) that I knew gave pleasing results. This got lost somewhere a long the way and I ended up reducing my goal to creating a pleasing tree.

Rather than talk about the structure of the code, which is pretty simple, I thought it would interesting to review the sequence of images I created and talk about the decisions I made to come up with the next version. The code to produce the images is available on [github.com/robertpi/FractalTree](https://github.com/robertpi/FractalTree) and will be linked to, if you want to see what the code changes look like. I didn't store my earliest version of the algorithm in git, so some of the earlier have been reversed engineered from later version, but I think they're pretty close to what I had."/>

                <p>I woke up early a couple of days ago and to pass the time till the rest of the house woke up, I decided to do a little hobby programming. I wanted to do a little animation around a star fractal. I didn't find the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake">Koch snowflake</a> astatically pleasing, so I thought I'd make my own based on a <a href="http://davis.wpi.edu/%7Ematt/courses/fractals/trees.html">tree fractal algorithm</a> that I knew gave pleasing results. This got lost somewhere a long the way and I ended up reducing my goal to creating a pleasing tree.</p>
<p>Rather than talk about the structure of the code, which is pretty simple, I thought it would interesting to review the sequence of images I created and talk about the decisions I made to come up with the next version. The code to produce the images is available on <a href="https://github.com/robertpi/FractalTree">github.com/robertpi/FractalTree</a> and will be linked to, if you want to see what the code changes look like. I didn't store my earliest version of the algorithm in git, so some of the earlier have been reversed engineered from later version, but I think they're pretty close to what I had.</p>
<p>I found the process interesting of creating the tree interesting. The algorithm is pretty simple and probably took about 10 mins to implement the original version, but since doing that I spent a few hours tuning it to give prettier results. This seems to embody the trade off faced in almost every domain of software development: basic results can be achieved quickly but producing pleasing results can take much effort to tune them.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://github.com/robertpi/FractalTree/commit/47777660f2f5cb3abec3cc9c446b9d5cff553def#diff-ef807e06fd550fdcb86c5cfd1e1e628f4b7528f9aa6c3e76714242594c3a1a8b">the first cut</a> I simply copy and pasted the pseudo code given in the <a href="http://davis.wpi.edu/%7Ematt/courses/fractals/trees.html">tree fractal algorithm</a> article and fixed it up till it was valid F#. The algorithm is simple, calculate the start and end of a branch from its length and angle, then plot the branch, adjust the length and angles before plotting the next branch.</p>
<p><img src="4777766.jpg" alt="First tree" /></p>
<p>It struck me that the tree was very pixelated. That seemed strange to me, since I can't remember that the last time I saw an image that looked pixelated, unless it was a deliberately added effect. I thought this was down to hardware improvements, and maybe a lot of it is, but it seems that most drawing libraries have some kind of smoothing turned on my default. The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing">System.Drawing namespace</a> does not have smoothing by default, but it is simple to opt-in. Once I <a href="https://github.com/robertpi/FractalTree/commit/300300eb7c7dd27ed54a508fd27f2e7d3a6598e5#diff-ef807e06fd550fdcb86c5cfd1e1e628f4b7528f9aa6c3e76714242594c3a1a8b">added smoothing</a>, the pixilation went away.</p>
<p><img src="300300.jpg" alt="Smoothed tree" /></p>
<p>I thought my trees looked more like grass. I little web searching led me to <a href="https://fractalfoundation.org/resources/fractivities/fractal-trees/">this article about fractal trees</a>, where the trees have a much more pleasing astatic. I noticed they weren't based on randomness but alternating angle sizes for the branches. It was fairly easy to <a href="https://github.com/robertpi/FractalTree/commit/cd4d193abe53e7601b0f8708407bf1d5c8b491a6">modify my program to produce that effect</a>.</p>
<p><img src="cd4d193.jpg" alt="Alternating tree" /></p>
<p>I liked this style, but the trees in the article looked better. I liked the way the branches slimmed on the way up the tree, this too was a <a href="https://github.com/robertpi/FractalTree/commit/3ff962d5128166f60b619ed74b24b918b82fb5a1">straight forward modification</a> (just one line moved).</p>
<p><img src="3ff962d.jpg" alt="Varying branches" /></p>
<p>The tree still looked a bit square, I was hoping for something a little more organic looking. I decided to <a href="https://github.com/robertpi/FractalTree/commit/b0e18a981d9d3b26757979a690bbcfd096c861a6">make the branches from ellipses</a>.</p>
<p><img src="b0e18a9.jpg" alt="Elliptical branches" /></p>
<p>The tree was looking fairly good by this point, but I thought I could do better. I didn't like the joins where branches met, my calculations left bits sticking out which looked messy. I could have tried to tune my calculations so this didn't happen, but another approach occurred to me. The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing">System.Drawing namespace</a> has methods that allow you to draw individual shapes like ellipses, but it also has methods let you draw polygons by defined by a list of points that form a path to plot. I decided to try and plot a whole path for the tree and then let the method <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing.graphics.fillclosedcurve?view=dotnet-plat-ext-5.0">FillClosedCurve</a> draw me a smooth tree.</p>
<p>This approach is tricky, it matters which order the points are passed to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing.graphics.fillclosedcurve?view=dotnet-plat-ext-5.0">FillClosedCurve</a> method, since this is the order they are drawn in. Any in error in the ordering of the points leads to a tree that curls around in strange way. This is differs from the approach of drawing individual branches, as the order individual branches are drawn in doesn't matter.</p>
<p>To make this approach work I embarked on a major refactoring of the program. This included creating a type that modelled to tree, using the type to generate a tree and then generating the path from the tree structure. The technique works okay, but I'm not that happy with <a href="https://github.com/robertpi/FractalTree/blob/4e74bd76fa70ea163947ecb6cb6c241ff6fe4fe8/FractalTrees/Tree.fs">the program's structure</a>, there seems to be quite a lot of repetition, particular I call Math.Sin and Math.Cos in a few different places, were I'm basically doing the same thing. But the effort of coming up with a better structure doesn't really seem worth it at this point.</p>
<p><img src="4e74bd7.jpg" alt="Tree from a path" /></p>
<p>I like the resulting tree a lot, but it's also not exactly what I had in mind. The calculation for the position of the edge of the branches is wrong somehow, but it's wrong in a way that produces a consistent art-deco like scroll effect, so I'll settle for that.</p>
<p>Now all that remains is to vary the parameters to create an animation, but that's for another day.</p>
<p>I hope this little tour of my programming decisions has interested you. Feel free <a href="https://twitter.com/robertpi/">to get in touch</a> with any comments.</p>
