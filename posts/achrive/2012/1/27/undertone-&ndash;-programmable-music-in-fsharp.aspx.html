<p>Recently I sent a bit of time playing with <a href="http://overtone.github.com/">Overtone</a>. I’ve always been interested in music, but have little talent when it comes to playing instruments, so I really like the idea of a DSL for creating music. I was also inspired by one of my Christmas presents <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wave-Watchers-Companion-Stadium-Undulations/dp/0399534261/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327663849&amp;sr=1-2&amp;tag=strangelights-20">The Wave Watchers Companion</a> to explore relationship between waves and sound. A secondary aim of playing with overtone was to learn a bit more about <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> which is definitely one of the most interesting languages about at the moment. I tried to resist the urge to port it F#, just enjoy learning about Clojure, but many of the ideas that make Overtone fun would work well in F#, so I couldn’t resist giving it a go.

To <a href="http://www.strangelights.com/fsharp/undertone/">try Undertone click this link</a> or the below screen shot:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.strangelights.com/fsharp/undertone/"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4679672/undertone.png" /></a></p>  <p>To say Undertone is a port of Overtone is probably a little unfair. Undertone takes a few ideas from Overtone and reimplements them in F#. Perhaps the biggest difference is that Overtone is uses the SuperCollider synthesis engine to generate sounds, where as Undertone has it’s own generation engine based on some work by <a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2009/07/A-Simple-Silverlight-3-Synthesizer-with-Keyboard-of-Sorts.html">Charles Petzold on creating a sequencer in Silverlight</a>. In Undertone a note or a tune is just a seq&lt;float&gt; (that’s IEnumerable&lt;Double&gt; for the C# folks) that oscillates between –1.0 and 1.0. Undertone provides 3 things, functions to help you generate individual notes – these are in the Undertone.Waves.Creation module, functions to transform notes – these are in the Undertone.Waves.Transformation module, and Player to play a sequences of notes – the Undertone.Player class.</p>  <p>So the creation of a note in Undertone would look something like this:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><font face="Courier New">let myNote note octave =        <br />    Creation.makeNote Creation.sawtooth 0.2 note octave        <br />    // apply transformations to you're note to adjust the way it sounds         <br />    |&gt; Transformation.flatten 0.8        <br />    |&gt; Transformation.tapper 1.0 0.3</font></p> </blockquote>  <p>This note can then be visualized using <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsdesktop/FSharpChart-b59073f5">F# Chart</a> and looks like this:    <br /></p>  <p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4679672/undertone_note.png" /></p>    <p>One you have a note you’re happy with it’s then easy to sequence them using F#’s list comprehension syntax:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><font face="Courier New">let tune =       <br />    seq { yield! myNote Note.C 5         <br />          yield! myNote Note.G 4         <br />          yield! myNote Note.E 4         <br />          yield! myNote Note.C 4         <br />          yield! myNote Note.G 3         <br />          yield! myNote Note.E 3         <br />          yield! myNote Note.C 3         <br />          yield! myNote Note.E 3         <br />          yield! myNote Note.G 3         <br />          yield! myNote Note.C 4         <br />          yield! myNote Note.E 4         <br />          yield! myNote Note.G 4         <br />          yield! myNote Note.E 4 }</font></p>    <p><font face="Courier New">// play the tune       <br />let player = Player.Play(tune, Repeat = true)</font></p> </blockquote>  <p>Although you can already make some interesting sounds with Undertone the project is in it’s infancy and there’s quite a few bits missing, notably:</p>  <p>- As there’s no direct way to port the sound generation technique used from Silverlight to .NET so there’s no way to play your tunes in the desktop version of F# interactive. This shouldn’t be that difficult to overcome, its just means writing a new .NET sound generation engine.</p>  <p>- There’s no way to visualize notes in Silverlight, so it would be nice to add a visualization capability</p>  <p>- More wave generation and transformation functions would be good, perhaps including functionality to extract real waves from WAV files, or other formats.</p>  <p>If your interested in improving the project, or just looking at the source, <a href="https://github.com/robertpi/Undertone">it can be found on github</a>.</p>  <p>The name of the project, Undertone, was inspired by Overtone itself with a nod to Northern Irish punk rock band <a href="http://www.theundertones.com/_/Home.html">The Undertones</a>.    </p>
