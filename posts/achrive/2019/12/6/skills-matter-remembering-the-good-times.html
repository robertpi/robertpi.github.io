                <p>Like so many others I felt sad when I heard the news Skill Matter had gone into administration. Many words have been exchange on twitter about what tragedy it was, so rather than add to that, I thought I’d share some of happy memories of them.</p>
<p>I can’t remember the exact date I first started working with Skills Matter, but it seems likely it was around 10 years ago. I remember the occasion very well.</p>
<p>I was invited to speak at ‘Progressive .NET’, running a tutorial on F# for them. Skills Matter hadn’t yet moved to their lovely venue at Goswell Road and the company had a small office in Clarkenwell and ran all events in external venues.</p>
<p>That year Progressive .NET was hosted at The Old Sessions House which is – I believe – a masonic lodge and masonic activities carried on around us. The event was great and the fact that a few talks on interrupted by the ring of bells or mail voice chanting in a nearby room, added a great deal of fun. It was my first and only chance to observe the masons close at hand, I enjoyed catching a glimpse of their robes and ceremonial swords.</p>
<p>We were able to have a drink at The Old Sessions House bar with the masons. Even in their ordinary clothes, there seemed to have a uniform, soba black suite, white shirt, dark tie. Many of them speaking with cockney / east London accent, I was surprised I didn’t think you could be working class and a mason.</p>
<p>I remember the Skill Matter team having some issues with the DSL line used for the conference Wi-Fi, after frustrating morning on the phone to BT Nick told me “if the masons can’t get good service, what hope is there for the rest of us?”</p>
<p>Why the big digression about the mason in a Skill Matter article? That is my first memory of them, but also because I think it illustrates the point that the team worked hard to bring a fantastic conference together whatever the circumstance.</p>
<p>One evening, at the Progressive .NET conference party that first year I went, I got talking to Wendy the Skill Matter founder and CEO. We were just having a beer and chatting, upstairs at The Crown Tavern. We talked a bit about my tutorial and how F# fitted in with .NET and the wider world of functional programming. I can’t remember who suggested it, but by the end of our chat we’d agreed to start Functional Programming eXchange conference.</p>
<p>I wasn’t entirely sure Wendy would follow though the conference idea. Had it just been one of those things that seemed like a good idea at the time in the pub. A few days later she got in touch and we started organizing the conference. I was very happy that she followed though and very impressed with the freedom skills matter gave me organizing the conference. Did I like someone’s work? Well, let’s invite them to the conference.</p>
<p>Functional Programming eXchange ran for a good few years then closed. I have many happy memories of the conference and I think we had some speakers that I would consider legendary. Why did it close? I changed jobs and had less free time to organize the conference. Also, it had helped inspire F# eXchange, Progressive F# and Haskell eXchange, possibly others, so we felt there was less need for a general functional programming conference at Skill Matter as the community was already being well served.</p>
<p>That’s only a brief over view of why I thought Skills Matter were great, but I think it illustrates what I liked about them. They enabled to the community to organize great invites and where very supportive of new ideas. They were always warm friendly and open.</p>
<p>I could include many more stories of people I’ve met and fun that I’ve had at conferences over the years - I may even have managed to learn a thing or two - but I'll leave it there for now.</p>
<p>I think Wendy and Nick did a great job of surrounding themselves with a lovely team of people who made organizing and attending lots of fun. I wish them all well in there future adventures.</p>
